# PolishElectionPredictor

## About the Project

Can a machine predict the outcome of elections based on polling data?

This project explores whether it's possible to forecast the results of Polish elections using only publicly available polling information. Unlike many similar studies, the data used here was collected manuallyâ€”without relying on ready-made datasets or APIs.

The idea is simple but challenging: take raw polling results, analyze the trends, and try to build a model that can estimate how people will actually vote. Polls aren't always accurate, and many factors influence elections, so this is also a test of how well a machine learning model can handle real-world uncertainty.

## Goal

The main goal of this project was to check how close machine-generated predictions can get to actual election results, using data that reflects the political mood in Poland over time.
